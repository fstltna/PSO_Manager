Edit "pmc" and change the settings at the top if your PSO server is not in /home/psoowner/PSOBBS_PC.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- cpan -i UI::Dialog
- cpan -i Term::ReadKey
- cpan -i Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my PSO Startup Script installed.

Then put this folder in your path so that you can run "pmc" from the command line.
